# Understanding settings

Each application requires you to specify what authentication and directory mode should be used. 

## Authentication modes

Authentication modes are mandatory and defines how the application will authenticate users against Authentick.

## Directory modes

Directory modes are optional. They define how users are provisioned on your applications. Configuring a directory mode is highly recommended to benefit from user discovery and automatic user suspension.
